Public data tables on the Payroll Protection Program by the U.S. Small Business Administration 

The U.S. [Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/) (SBA) is operating the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) as funded by the C.A.R.E.S. act. Through scattered reports and press releases, the SBA has provided some data tables on the allocation of PPP loans. Those reports are collected in \PDFs.

Selected tables are included as CSV files. In addition, report and coverages dates are provided, as well as .Rdata files and the associated R code to process the CSV files. Code and files are self-explanatory.

If there is interest and additional reports I will process them and update the repository.

## Acknowledgments
